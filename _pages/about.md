Greetings!

I am a Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at the Toyota Technological Institute in Chicago (TTIC). I am grateful to be advised by [Prof. Karen Livescu](https://home.ttic.edu/~klivescu/). Prior to TTIC, I finished my B.Tech+M.Tech in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB), where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Preeti Rao](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/prao).

Over the course of my research journey, I have been interested in multimodal learning, semi-supervised learning, spoken language understanding, and more recently discovering what self-supervised speech models learn. I have participated in research internships at Google Brain and ASAPP.

I have served as a reviewer for ACL, ICASSP, Interspeech, EMNLP, and SLT, and have been a co-chair of the Women at TTIC group.
